# Installation Instructions

Installing QGDipoles.jl is fairly straightforward and can be done using the Julia package manager.
Note that QGDipoles is not (currently) listed as a Julia package so **cannot** be installed using `] add QGDipoles`.
It is recommended to [create a new environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) for each project and install any new packages to that environment. 

## Installation

Installation may be done using the package manager directly by typing `]` at the Julia REPL and entering the following:
```julia
add https://github.com/mncrowe/QGDipoles.jl.git
instantiate
```
Alternatively, you may import the package manager and install by entering the following directly into the Julia REPL:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mncrowe/QGDipoles.jl")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
This package is not compatible with versions of Julia earlier than 1.10 due to the `eachslice` function.

## Dependencies

This package requires the following dependencies:

* FFTW (v1.8.0)
* Jacobi (v0.7.0)
* LinearAlgebra
* NLsolve (v4.5.1)
* QuadGK (v2.9.4)
* SpecialFunctions (v2.4.0)
* CUDA (v5.4.3)
* RecipesBase (v1.3.4)

The specified versions are confirmed to work and earlier/later versions may also work.
These packages will be automatically installed with QGDipoles.jl and do not need to be added seperately.
