# This example is covered in example 5 of docs/documentation.md and combines GDipoles.jl with
# GeophysicalFlows.jl to simulate a steadily propagating dipole

using GeophysicalFlows, QGDipoles

# Define vortex parameters

U, ℓ = 1, 1

# Set numerical simulation parameters

nx, ny = 1024, 1024
Lx, Ly = 20.48, 20.48
T = 10
Δt = 0.01
Nt = Int(T / Δt)# number of timesteps
dev = CPU()
stepper = "FilteredRK4"

# Define problem using SingleLayerQG from GeophysicalFlows.jl

prob = SingleLayerQG.Problem(
    dev;
    nx,
    ny,
    Lx,
    Ly,
    U = -U,# background flow so vortex remains stationary
    dt = Δt,
    stepper,
)

# Set initial condition

_, q₀, K = CreateLCD(prob.grid; U, ℓ)
q₀ = reshape(q₀, nx, ny)# convert from size (nx, ny, 1) to size (nx, ny)
SingleLayerQG.set_q!(prob, q₀)

# Define Energy as a diagnostic for the simulation

diags = Diagnostic(SingleLayerQG.energy, prob; nsteps = Nt, freq = Int(Nt / 100))

# Evolve system forward in time

stepforward!(prob, diags, Nt)
SingleLayerQG.updatevars!(prob)

# Plot initial and final fields if we have `Plots.jl` added

# using Plots
# plot(heatmap(prob.grid, q₀), heatmap(prob.grid, prob.vars.q))
